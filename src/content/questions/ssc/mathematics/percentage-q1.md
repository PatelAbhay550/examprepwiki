question: "If 25% of a number is 75, what is 40% of that number?"
options:
  - "100"
  - "120"
  - "150"
  - "180"
correctAnswer: 1
explanation: "First, find the number: If 25% of x = 75, then x = 75 × (100/25) = 75 × 4 = 300. Now find 40% of 300: 40% of 300 = (40/100) × 300 = 120. Therefore, the answer is 120."
