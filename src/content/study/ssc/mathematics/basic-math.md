# Basic Mathematics for SSC CGL

## Number System

### Types of Numbers

**Natural Numbers (N):** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...

**Whole Numbers (W):** 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...

**Integers (Z):** ..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...

**Rational Numbers (Q):** Numbers that can be expressed as p/q where q ≠ 0

**Irrational Numbers:** Numbers that cannot be expressed as fractions (√2, π, e)

### Divisibility Rules

| Number | Rule |
|--------|------|
| 2 | Last digit is even (0, 2, 4, 6, 8) |
| 3 | Sum of digits is divisible by 3 |
| 4 | Last two digits form a number divisible by 4 |
| 5 | Last digit is 0 or 5 |
| 6 | Divisible by both 2 and 3 |
| 8 | Last three digits form a number divisible by 8 |
| 9 | Sum of digits is divisible by 9 |
| 10 | Last digit is 0 |
| 11 | Difference between sum of odd place digits and even place digits is 0 or divisible by 11 |

### Important Formulas

**Sum of first n natural numbers:** n(n+1)/2

**Sum of squares:** n(n+1)(2n+1)/6

**Sum of cubes:** [n(n+1)/2]²

## Algebra

### Basic Identities

1. (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b²
2. (a - b)² = a² - 2ab + b²
3. (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b²
4. (a + b)³ = a³ + 3a²b + 3ab² + b³
5. (a - b)³ = a³ - 3a²b + 3ab² - b³
6. a³ + b³ = (a + b)(a² - ab + b²)
7. a³ - b³ = (a - b)(a² + ab + b²)

### Linear Equations

**Standard Form:** ax + by = c

**Slope-Intercept Form:** y = mx + c (where m is slope)

## Geometry

### Triangle Properties

**Pythagoras Theorem:** a² + b² = c² (for right triangle)

**Area of Triangle:**
- Base × Height / 2
- √[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)] (Heron's Formula, where s = semi-perimeter)

**Types of Triangles:**
- Equilateral: All sides equal
- Isosceles: Two sides equal
- Scalene: All sides different

### Circle

**Circumference:** 2πr

**Area:** πr²

**Area of Sector:** (θ/360) × πr²

**Length of Arc:** (θ/360) × 2πr

### Important Formulas

**Rectangle:**
- Area = Length × Breadth
- Perimeter = 2(Length + Breadth)

**Square:**
- Area = Side²
- Perimeter = 4 × Side
- Diagonal = Side × √2

**Parallelogram:**
- Area = Base × Height

**Trapezium:**
- Area = (1/2) × (Sum of parallel sides) × Height

## Percentage

**Basic Formula:** (Part/Whole) × 100

**Percentage Increase:** [(New - Old)/Old] × 100

**Percentage Decrease:** [(Old - New)/Old] × 100

## Profit and Loss

**Profit:** Selling Price - Cost Price

**Loss:** Cost Price - Selling Price

**Profit %:** (Profit/CP) × 100

**Loss %:** (Loss/CP) × 100

**SP when Profit % is given:** CP × (100 + Profit%)/100

**SP when Loss % is given:** CP × (100 - Loss%)/100

## Simple and Compound Interest

**Simple Interest:** (P × R × T)/100

**Compound Interest:** P(1 + R/100)^T - P

Where:
- P = Principal
- R = Rate per annum
- T = Time in years

## Time and Work

**Basic Formula:** Work = Time × Efficiency

**If A can do work in 'x' days and B in 'y' days, together they complete in:**
(xy)/(x+y) days

## Speed, Distance, and Time

**Basic Formula:** Speed = Distance/Time

**Average Speed:** Total Distance/Total Time

**Relative Speed:**
- When moving in same direction: |S₁ - S₂|
- When moving in opposite direction: S₁ + S₂

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Number System
Find the number of factors of 360.

**Solution:** 
360 = 2³ × 3² × 5¹
Number of factors = (3+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 24

### Problem 2: Percentage
A number is increased by 20% and then decreased by 20%. What is the net change?

**Solution:**
Net change = -4% (decrease)
Formula: -xy/100 where x = 20, y = 20

### Problem 3: Time and Work
A can complete work in 12 days, B in 15 days. How long will they take together?

**Solution:**
Together = (12 × 15)/(12 + 15) = 180/27 = 6.67 days

## Quick Tips for SSC CGL

1. **Memorize multiplication tables** up to 30
2. **Learn squares** up to 30 and cubes up to 20
3. **Practice mental calculations** regularly
4. **Use approximation** for faster calculations
5. **Identify pattern** in questions
6. **Time management** is crucial - don't spend too much time on one question
