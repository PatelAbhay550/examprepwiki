question: "Who invented the Telephone?"
answer: "Alexander Graham Bell"
detailedAnswer: "Alexander Graham Bell, a Scottish-born scientist and inventor, is credited with inventing the telephone. He was granted the first US patent for the invention of the telephone on March 7, 1876 (US Patent No. 174,465). Bell successfully transmitted the first intelligible telephone message on March 10, 1876, saying 'Mr. Watson, come here, I want to see you' to his assistant Thomas Watson. However, there is controversy around this invention, as Italian inventor Antonio Meucci had developed a similar device earlier but lacked resources to patent it, and Elisha Gray filed a patent caveat on the same day as Bell. Despite the controversy, Bell is officially recognized as the inventor of the telephone."
