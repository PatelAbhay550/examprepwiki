question: "Who invented Zero (0)?"
answer: "Aryabhata (India) and Brahmagupta formalized it"
detailedAnswer: "The concept of zero was developed in ancient India. While the Babylonians and Mayans used placeholder symbols, Indian mathematicians were the first to treat zero as a number with its own value. Aryabhata (476-550 CE) used zero in his astronomical calculations, and Brahmagupta (598-668 CE) was the first to formally define zero and establish rules for arithmetic operations involving zero in his work 'Brahmasphutasiddhanta' (628 CE). The symbol and concept later spread to the Arab world and then to Europe, revolutionizing mathematics and science."

## Question: Who invented Zero (0)?

### Short Answer
**Zero was invented in Ancient India**, with significant contributions by **Aryabhata** (5th century CE) and formalized by **Brahmagupta** (7th century CE).

### Detailed Explanation

The invention of zero is one of the most significant contributions of ancient India to world mathematics and science.

#### Evolution of Zero

1. **Early Placeholder Concepts**
   - Babylonians (300 BCE): Used placeholder symbol
   - Mayans: Developed independently for their calendar
   - Neither used zero as a number with its own value

2. **Indian Innovation**
   - **Aryabhata (476-550 CE)**: Used zero in place-value system
   - **Brahmagupta (628 CE)**: First to treat zero as a number
   - Established mathematical operations with zero

#### Brahmagupta's Groundbreaking Work

In his treatise **"Brahmasphutasiddhanta" (628 CE)**, Brahmagupta defined:

- **Addition**: a + 0 = a
- **Subtraction**: a - 0 = a
- **Multiplication**: a × 0 = 0
- **Division**: He attempted to define a ÷ 0 (though modern mathematics considers it undefined)

#### Journey from India to the World

1. **7th-8th Century**: Arab mathematicians learned from Indian texts
2. **Al-Khwarizmi (9th Century)**: Introduced Indian numerals to Islamic world
3. **12th Century**: Fibonacci brought it to Europe
4. **Symbol Evolution**: The circular symbol (०) came from Sanskrit 'shunya' (void)

#### Impact on Civilization

- Enabled place-value number system
- Made complex calculations possible
- Foundation for modern computing and digital technology
- Essential for calculus and advanced mathematics

#### Why This Matters for Exams

Frequently tested topic covering:
- Ancient Indian contributions to science
- History of mathematics
- Cultural heritage questions
- Scientific achievements of civilizations

#### Common Related Questions

- Who formalized the rules of zero?
- Which ancient civilization invented zero?
- What is the Sanskrit word for zero?
- When was zero invented?
- How did zero reach Europe?

## Exam Tips

- **Key Names**: Aryabhata (used it) + Brahmagupta (formalized it)
- **Date**: 628 CE (Brahmasphutasiddhanta)
- **Sanskrit Term**: "Shunya" (शून्य) meaning void/empty
- **Symbol Origin**: Circular symbol from Sanskrit notation
- **Indian Contribution**: Remember this is India's gift to world mathematics

## Important Distinctions

| Aspect | Contribution |
|--------|--------------|
| **Aryabhata** | Used zero in calculations, place-value system |
| **Brahmagupta** | Defined zero as a number, established arithmetic rules |
| **Indian System** | Zero as both placeholder AND number |
| **Other Civilizations** | Only placeholder, not a number |
