question: "Who is known as the Father of Algebra?"
answer: "Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi"
detailedAnswer: "Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi (c. 780-850 CE), a Persian mathematician and astronomer, is widely recognized as the Father of Algebra. Working in the House of Wisdom in Baghdad during the Islamic Golden Age, he wrote the groundbreaking book 'Al-Kitab al-Mukhtasar fi Hisab al-Jabr wal-Muqabala' (The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing), from which the word 'algebra' is derived. His systematic approach to solving linear and quadratic equations laid the foundation for modern algebra. The term 'algorithm' also comes from the Latinized version of his name."
